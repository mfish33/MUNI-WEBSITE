# MUNI Website

MUNI is a website and community empowering recent college grads to reach financial freedom. The website is live at [learnmuni.com](https://learnmuni.com). The website was built using angular and firebase. Below are the instructions developing and building the angular app. Please read the README in the functions folder for modifying the cloud functions.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
